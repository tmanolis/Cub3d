# Cub3D

This project is inspired by the game Wolfeinstein3D, considered the first FPS ever developed. It will allow you to explore the technique of ray-casting. Your objective is to create a dynamic view within a maze, in which you will have to find your way.

## Summary
Cub3D is a project that introduces you to the world of ray-casting, enabling you to build a dynamic view within a maze-like environment. Through this project, you will gain insights into the fundamentals of game development, graphics programming, and spatial navigation algorithms.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the program using the provided Makefile.
3. Run the executable with appropriate arguments to explore different maze configurations.
4. Dive into the codebase to understand the ray-casting technique and its implementation.

## Usage
```bash
./cub3d [map_file.cub]
